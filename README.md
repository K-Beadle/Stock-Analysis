# Stock-Analysis

##Overview of project

 ###Purpose
  
  The purpose of this analysis was to find out how the company Daqos' stock performed in 2018 for a clients parents. They wanted to see the total trading volume because they believe an often traded stock accurately reflects its value. They also wanted to calculate the annual rate of return. Then, we analysed the 11 other companies in the data set for both 2017 and 2018 so the clients parents could compare the performance of the company they were interested in to the others in the data set.

  The result from analyzing the Daqo stock performance for the year 2018 is that the total volume of stocks traded was 107,873,900 and if you had purchased DQ's stock at the beginning of the year and held it until the end of the year then your calculated rate of return would be -63%. From these results we can conclude that Daqo is most likely not advisable to invest your money into based on its 2018 rate of return. We can not say much about the trading volume unless we compare it to other companies.
